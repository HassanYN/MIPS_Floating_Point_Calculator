# Floating Point Calculator
This project is an implementation of a floating-point calculator for the MIPS architecture. It allows performing basic arithmetic operations—addition, 
subtraction, and multiplication—on two user-input floating-point numbers. The calculator
handles these operations using both built-in MIPS instructions and custom implementations 
to demonstrate understanding and manipulation of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.
## Features
- Prompt the user to input two floating-point numbers.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication using MIPS instructions.
- Implement custom floating-point operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) following IEEE 754 standards.
- Display results for both MIPS built-in instructions and custom implementations.
## Requirements
- MIPS simulator (e.g., [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/index.htm))
